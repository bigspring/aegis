        <h1>Welcome to the Machine</h1>
        <p class="lead">Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been.</p>
        <p>You've been in the pipeline, filling in time, Provided with toys and Scouting for Boys. You bought a guitar to punish your ma, And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool, So welcome to the machine.
        <p>Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream. You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar, He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar. So welcome to the machine.</p>
